Polyglot E-Commerce Microservices Project - Revision Summary

Overview:
This project is a simplified e-commerce backend built with a microservices architecture using Node.js and multiple databases to demonstrate polyglot persistence.

Key Microservices:
1. User Service (PostgreSQL)
   - User registration and login with JWT authentication.
   - Endpoints:
     POST /api/users/register
     POST /api/users/login
     GET /api/users/profile (protected)

2. Product Service (MongoDB)
   - Add and fetch product details.
   - Endpoints:
     POST /api/products
     GET /api/products/:id

3. Order Service (PostgreSQL)
   - Place orders and retrieve order history enriched with product details via Axios.
   - Endpoints:
     POST /api/orders
     GET /api/orders/:email

4. Analytics Service (PostgreSQL)
   - Analyzes and fetches top-selling products.
   - Endpoint:
     GET /api/top-products

Tech Highlights:
- JWT for auth
- Axios for inter-service communication
- PostgreSQL for relational data (Users, Orders)
- MongoDB for document data (Products)
- Polyglot persistence with multiple DBs
